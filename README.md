This was a problem given by my professor, It was fun to do it. I 'm going to paste the problem because it is too long

Create a program to book airline tickets. 
The program should read information about flights (number, origin and destination) and the number of seats available for twelve planes (a vector for each of these data). 
After reading, the program should present a menu for:
consult, make a reservation and leave. 
For the option to consult another menu with options, it must offer options to: by flight number, by origin, by destination. 
To select the option to make a reservation, you must ask which flight number the user wants to travel. 
Then, enter one of the following messages: reservation confirmed if the flight and seat are available, canceling the available seats; full flight if there is no seat
available on that flight; 
non-existent flight if the flight code does not exist. The exit option ends the execution of the program.
